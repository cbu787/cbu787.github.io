					<p>Hi, I'm Callum - a junior web developer based in Toronto. After moving across the country from Vancouver last year, I decided to change career paths. I enrolled in and completed an intensive, fully-immersive nine-week Web Development course at <a href="https://bitmaker.co">Bitmaker</a>, Canada's leading tech skills accelerator.</p></br>

					<p>The course was challenging, but rewarding in equal measure, and it left me with the drive to develop my skills further in an industry which is new and exciting to me. I feel that I have only just scratched the surface of what this industry has to offer, and so I am keen to find a role in which I can utilize and develop my recently-acquired skills, while working with and learning from other developers.</p></br>

					<p>From my career prior to becoming a web developer, I will bring over seven years' experience in client- or customer-facing roles in Canada and the UK. My most recent roles involved working in interdisciplinary teams on projects with strict deadlines, with a focus on compliance with company and client specifications; experience which I feel will be of great benefit in my first role as a developer in the tech industry.</p>

					<p>So far, my <a href="https://github.com/cbu787">Github portfolio</a> is comprised of assignments and projects from the Bitmaker course. I completed some of the assignments more than once to help myself understand them better, rather than just following the instructions through to a successful end result.</p>
					<p>Below are some of the projects I worked on during the Bitmaker course:</p></br>
					<a href="https://bandaide.herokuapp.com"><h3>Band Aide (Bitmaker final group project)</h3></a>
					<p>An app designed to unite bands with musicians in their local area. Google Maps shows who's looking near you; contact other musicians to jam or apply join a band of your choice. The final group project, built by a team of four using Rails, Foundation, JavaScript/AJAX, Carrierwave, Devise and Google Maps, and deployed to Heroku.</p></br>
					<a href="https://github.com/cbu787/crowdfunder"><h3>Crowdfunder</h3></a>
					<p>A scaled-down version of crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, built by a team of four using Rails and JavaScript/AJAX.</p></br>
					<a href="https://github.com/cbu787/table_dynamix"><h3>TableDynamix</h3></a>
					<p>A scaled-down version of restaurant reservation service OpenTable, built by a team of four using Rails.</p></br>
					<a href="https://github.com/cbu787/naughts-crosses"><h3>Naughts & Crosses</h3></a>
					<p>A basic two-player game of "Tic-Tac-Toe" made with JavaScript/jQuery. I had to call it by its British name (old habits die hard).</p>
